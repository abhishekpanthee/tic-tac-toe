# Bash Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Bash.

## Overview

This Bash script allows two players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the terminal. Players take turns to place their respective markers ('x' and 'o') on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their marker, or when the grid is full resulting in a draw.
